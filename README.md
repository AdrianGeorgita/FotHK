### Game Story

The Kingdom of Men lived peacefully and prospered in an era of peace that lasted for hundreds of years. The knights of the Order of the Phoenix had protected and maintained order and peace in the kingdom since the order's founding.

On a mission to capture the former knight Lodrax, who was suspected of treason and rebellion, they were annihilated by Lodrax's followers—the newly proclaimed king of creatures—allowing him to invade and burn the kingdom of men to the ground.

The Grand Master of the Order of the Phoenix was returning from a diplomatic mission when he saw the ruins of the kingdom. Driven by a desire for vengeance and determined to end Lodrax's tyranny, he set out on a mission to kill him and save the fate of humanity.
